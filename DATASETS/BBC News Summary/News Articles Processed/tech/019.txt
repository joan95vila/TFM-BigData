intel unveils laser breakthrough intel unveil research could mean data soon move around chip speed light scientist intel overcome fundamental problem prevent silicon use generate amplify laser light breakthrough make easy interconnect data network chip process information intel researcher say product exploit breakthrough appear end decade overcome fundamental limit say dr mario paniccia director intel photonics technology lab write journal nature dr paniccia colleague haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak alexander fang show make continuous laser material use make computer processor currently say dr paniccia telecommunication equipment amplifies laser light travel fibre optic cable expensive exotic material gallium arsenide use make telecommunication firm chip maker would prefer use silicon element cheap many problem use manufacture solve try take silicon competency manufacture apply new area say dr paniccia work do make component move light around silicon successfully use generate amplify laser light pulse use send data long distance despite fact silicon much well amplifier light pulse form material use fibre optic cable improve amplification due crystalline structure silicon use make computer chip dr paniccia say structure silicon mean laser light pass collide photon rip electron atom within material creates cloud electron sit silicon absorbs light say intel researcher find way suck away errant electron turn silicon material generate amplify laser light even well laser light produce way help filter tune across wide range frequency laser make produce light narrow frequency range result could close integration fibre optic cable carry data light computer chip process dr paniccia say work one several step need silicon use make component could carry process light form data pulse technical validation work say
